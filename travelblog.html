The Colosseum is one of the most famous attractions in Rome and is where most gladiatorial fights took place. Today, actors in gladiator clothes stand outside the Colosseum, where you can take pictures with them (for a price!) The Colosseum is a testament to the ingenuity of the builders, having stood the test of time. While parts have been damaged, the Colosseum still remains standing in most of its original glory today. It is advisable that you buy your tickets in advance to skip the ticketing queue, which can be quite the time saver!
